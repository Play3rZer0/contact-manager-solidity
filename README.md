# contact-manager-solidity
A contact manager app written in Solidity

We will build a simple contact manager. Here are the steps to follow:

-Create the struct that will store the data for the contacts called 'Contact'.
-Create a mapping of the a uint256 data type for ID number to the struct 'Contact'.
-Create a function called addContact() that will allow users to add a new contact.
-Create a function called getContact() that will allow users to retrieve information about a contact that was added, using the key value for the ID number as the query parameter.
